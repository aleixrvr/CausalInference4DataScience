# CausalInference4DataScience

This is the repository for the examples and exercises from the book "Causal Inference for Data Science". You can find the code used in the book in the `code` path, and the results of the exercises in `exercises`. 

Notebooks are written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and later on rendered to ipynb (for python code) and html (for R) files. The reason is that, unlike Jupyter Notebooks, `qmd` files are text files, and as such, you can keep track of the changes using version control software.
