# Creating spurious correlations

```{python}
from numpy.random import uniform, seed, normal
from numpy import arange, corrcoef
import pandas as pd

seed(1234)

time = arange(2000, 2010)
population = (
    280 + 3 * (time - 2000) + normal(size=len(time), scale=0.1)
)  # in millions of people
revenue = (
    1.25 + (population - 280) * 0.015 + normal(size=len(time), scale=0.05)
)  # in billions of dollars
doctorates = (
    700 + (population - 280) * 30 + normal(size=len(time), scale=10)
)  # in number of people
```

Correlation between revenue and doctorates.

```{python}
corrcoef(doctorates, revenue)[0][1]
```
