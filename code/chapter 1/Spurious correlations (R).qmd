# Creating spurious correlations


```{r}

set.seed(1234)

time <- 2000:2009
population <- (
    280 + 3 * (time - 2000) + rnorm(n=length(time), sd=0.1)
)  # in millions of people
revenue <- (
    1.25 + (population - 280) * 0.015 + rnorm(n=length(time), sd=0.05)
)  # in billions of dollars
doctorates <- (
    700 + (population - 280) * 30 + rnorm(n=length(time), sd=10)
)  # in number of people
```

Correlation between revenue and doctorates.

```{r}
cor(doctorates, revenue)
```
