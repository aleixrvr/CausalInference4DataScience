# Data simulation

```{python}
from numpy.random import seed, normal, uniform
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

seed(1234)
n = 100

confounder = uniform(size=n)
treatment = -3 * confounder + normal(size=n)
outcome = -2 * confounder + 5 * treatment + normal(size=n)
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"confounder": confounder, "treatment": treatment, "outcome": outcome}
)
```

# Linear estimation controlling for confounders

```{python}
model = sm.OLS(outcome, df[["treatment", "confounder"]]).fit()
model.params
```


# FWL strategy 

```{python}
model_treatment = sm.OLS(treatment, confounder).fit()
residuals_treatment = treatment - model_treatment.predict(confounder)
model_outcome = sm.OLS(outcome, confounder).fit()
residuals_outcome = outcome - model_outcome.predict(confounder)
sm.OLS(residuals_outcome, residuals_treatment).fit().params
```
