# Data simulation

Data obtained from [google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-01%202016-12-01&geo=US&q=Lord%20of%20the%20Rings,%2Fm%2F0fdv3&hl=en). Google Trends are calculated based on resampling, so the data might be slightly different every time you download it.


Reading the data

```{python message=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import causalimpact
import seaborn as sns
from numpy import where

weeks_post = 2

data = pd.read_csv("gtrends_sc.csv")
release_day = where(data.Week == "2015-12-20")[0][0]
data["Week"] = pd.to_datetime(data["Week"])
```

Ploting the data

```{python}
sns.lineplot(x="Week", y="III", data=data)
sns.lineplot(x="Week", y="LoTR", data=data)
```

Applying SC with the `CausalImpact` library.

```{python}
data_CI = data[["III", "LoTR"]]
data_CI.columns = ["y", "x1"]
pre_period = [0, release_day - 1]
post_period = [release_day, release_day + weeks_post]

estimated_impact = causalimpact.fit_causalimpact(data_CI, pre_period, post_period)
print(causalimpact.summary(estimated_impact, output_format="summary"))
```


The impact of the release on the interest of the III is 179.3 (148.3, 208.8).
